"""yt-dlp argv construction for download.py.

Regression guard: ``--sub-langs all`` makes yt-dlp fetch YouTube's hundreds of
auto-translated caption tracks, which can take minutes and stalls before the
video download even starts. The request must therefore stay bounded — but
bounded is not the same as English-only: asking for ``en.*`` on a Turkish video
returns a machine translation and silently discards the spoken words. So we ask
for the original track plus English as a fallback, which resolves to two tracks
(measured: ``Downloading subtitles: tr-orig, en``), not hundreds.
